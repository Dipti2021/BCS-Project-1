 ## Introduction 
 Over the last decade or so, the music industry has been experiencing a seismic and possibly irreversible change. With the introduction of modern electronics, it is noÂ longer required to design a new physical instrument.This has made it difficult for people of all ages to know, learn and play any instrument that may be exotic, ancient, belonging to a specific regional or country or for that matter any instrument that they may like! We did our bit by creating an app that not only allows a user of any age to know about any musical instrument that he may be interested in, but also he will be able to go through the history of that instrument and get to know about it in much detail.
Not only this, but the user will be able to learn how to play the searched instrument with the help of a series of video tutorials. And if getting bored you can play some instruments to prop up your mood.
